Data Science for Economics
==============================================

In this part of the course we will mostly focus on machine learning methods. We will be using `Julia` as our primary programming language. Don't worry if you have never worked with `Julia`, you can continue working in `R`. Most of your `R` code can be called into `Julia` with a a package called `RCall.jl`!

`Julia` and `Python` are great languages for machine learning, with many libraries and packages for you to use. My preference is to use `Julia`, but `Python` is used more widely in industry. Luckily the differences between the languages are not that different, so learning the one will help with learning the other.

In this course we **officially** use `R`. So I will often provide you with `R` code. For my section, however, it is more important that you understand the machine learning concepts and then you can implement it in any language tha you prefer.  

# Topics

Below are some of the topics that we will cover during this term.

1. Introduction to `Julia`
2. Working with data in `Julia`
3. Linear algebra and basic statistics
4. Linear and polynomial regression
5. k-Nearest neigbours
6. Tree-based methods
7. Support vector machines
8. Neural networks and deep learning

We might not be able to cover much of deep learning. This completely depends on how fast we move through the other material. However, it is important to note that the techniques that you are presented in this section will be enough for you to succesfully complete a project.
