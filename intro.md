Data Science for Economics
==============================================

In this part of the course we will mostly focus on machine learning methods. We will be using both `Julia` and `R` as our programming languages. Don't worry if you have never worked with `Julia`, you can continue working in `R`. Most of your `R` code can also be called into `Julia` with a a package called `RCall.jl`. Originally this course used `Python` in addition to `R`, however I have started using `Julia` more in my daily workflow and believe it has several distinct advantages over `Python`. 

Just to make it clear, in this course we **officially** use `R`, which means I will provide you with `R` code (even if we work with `Julia`). For my section it is more important that you understand the machine learning concepts and then you can implement it in any language that you prefer. At this stage in your career as an economist / data scientist, you can focus on one programming language to fulfill most of your needs. However, as you develop your skills you will notice that the language you use is almost irrelevant. Someone that is highly trained in `Python`, for example, and knows how to execute certain ideas effectively in that language should be able to transfer those skills to other languages in a short time frame. The reason to showcase `Julia` in this course is then partly to show that you can easily switch between languages if needed, and also to show that sometimes one tool might be better for a specific goal. The syntax of `Julia` is quite similar to that of `Python`, so it should be quite easy for you to transfer your newfound knowledge into a `Python` environment. `Julia` is also quite similar to `Matlab` in the way that code is formulated, so those of you with `Matlab` experience will feel quite at home using `Julia`. 

# Topics

Below are some of the topics that we will cover during this term.

1. Introduction to `Julia` (self-study)
2. Working with data in `Julia` (self-study)
3. Linear algebra and optimisation
4. Linear and polynomial regression
5. k-Nearest neighbours
6. Tree-based methods
7. Support vector machines
8. Neural networks 
9. Parallel programming
10. Cloud computing with Google Compute Engine
11. Databases (SQL and BigQuery)
12. Spark and `R` / `Julia`

We will not have time to cover all the topics in full detail, so you can refer to the notes if you would like to know more. I will also link to other sets of notes so that you can read in more detail on some of the issues at hand. Since most of you have little experience with machine learning and programming, we will be taking things quite slow. In that sense this course provides you the basic tools from which you can go and further explore.
