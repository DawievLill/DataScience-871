Data Science for Economics
==============================================

In this part of the course we will mostly focus on machine learning methods. We will be using both `Julia` and `R` as our programming languages. Don't worry if you have never worked with `Julia`, you can continue working in `R`. Most of your `R` code can also be called into `Julia` with a a package called `RCall.jl`.

```{note}
We will sometimes use `Julia`, since it is a great language for machine learning, with many packages for you to use. My preference is to use `Julia`, but `R` and `Python` are used more widely in industry.
```

In this course we **officially** use `R`, which means I will provide you with `R` code (even if we work with `Julia`). For my section it is more important that you understand the machine learning concepts and then you can implement it in any language that you prefer.  

# Topics

Below are some of the topics that we will cover during this term.

1. Introduction to `Julia`
2. Working with data in `Julia`
3. Relational databases
4. Linear and polynomial regression
5. k-Nearest neigbours
6. Tree-based methods
7. Support vector machines
8. Neural networks and deep learning **(time dependent)
9. Cloud and parallel computing **(time dependent)

We might not be able to cover much of deep learning and cloud computing. This depends on how fast we move through the other material. However, it is important to note that the techniques that you are presented in this section will be enough for you to succesfully complete a project.
