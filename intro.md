Data Science for Economics
==============================================

In this part of the course we will mostly focus on machine learning methods. We will be using both `Julia` and `R` as our programming languages. Don't worry if you have never worked with `Julia`, you can continue working in `R`. Most of your `R` code can also be called into `Julia` with a a package called `RCall.jl`. Originally this course used `Python` in addition to `R`, however I have started using `Julia` more in my daily workflow and believe it has several distinct advantages over `Python`. 

Just to make it clear, in this course we **officially** use `R`, which means I will provide you with `R` code (even if we work with `Julia`). For my section it is more important that you understand the machine learning concepts and then you can implement it in any language that you prefer.  

# Topics

Below are some of the topics that we will cover during this term.

1. Introduction to `Julia` (self-study)
2. Working with data in `Julia`
3. Linear algebra and optimisation
4. Linear and polynomial regression
5. k-Nearest neighbours
6. Tree-based methods
7. Support vector machines
8. Neural networks 
9. Parallel programming
10. Cloud computing with Google Compute Engine
11. Databases (SQL and BigQuery)
12. Spark and `R` / `Julia`

We will not have time to cover all the topics in full detail, so you can refer to the notes if you would like to know more.
