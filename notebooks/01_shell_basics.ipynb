You might be used to working with graphical user interfaces for most of your coding career, but it is useful to know how to work through the shell. This is not something that is often taught in economics programs, but if you are looking at a career in data science this might be very useful.

The only boilerplate file that you need to concern yourself with is the `README` document, which we will talk about a bit more when we deal with **version control**. You will notice that this has the `.md` extension, which indicates that this is a Markdown file. This entire notebook was written in Markdown and I will talk about the format briefly in the lecture.
