I use [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), but I think that [PopOS](https://pop.system76.com/) is a good Linux distribution to start with. It is quite similar to MacOS and you don't need to use the command line as frequently as with other Linux distributions. \n",

You might be used to working with graphical user interfaces for most of your coding career, but it is useful to know how to work through the shell. This is not something that is often taught in economics programs, but if you are looking at a career in data science this might be very useful. [Here](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/03-shell/03-shell.html#14) are some of the reasons why we might be interested in using the shell.
