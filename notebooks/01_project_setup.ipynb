    "In this folder structure you can see a broad template for organising a small project. For this project you see that here is a `README` file that gives us the basic information of the project. You might often see `licence`, `conduct` and `citation` files in projects, but we won't be dealing with those in detail in this course. The only boilerplate file that you need to concern yourself with is the `README` document, which we will talk about a bit more when we deal with **version control**. You will notice that this has the `.md` extension, which indicates that this is a Markdown file. This entire notebook was written in Markdown and I will talk about the format briefly in the lecture.
