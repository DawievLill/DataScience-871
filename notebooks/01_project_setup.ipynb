    "In this folder structure you can see a broad template for organising a small project. For this project you see that here is a `README` file that gives us the basic information of the project. You might often see `licence`, `conduct` and `citation` files in projects on Github, but we won't be dealing with those just yet. For now the only boilerplate file that you need to concern yourself with is the `README` document. You will notice that this has the `.md` extension, which indicates that this is a Markdown file. This entire notebook was written in Markdown and I will talk about the format briefly in the lecture.  "
