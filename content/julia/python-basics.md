Getting started with Python
==============================================

In this notebook we will be going over some of the basics of `Python`. There are several excellent resources to get a better understanding of the language and I will reference them in this text. The best way to learn a new language is to try and code up something that you care about. Think about a specific project and try to implement it using the new language. Along the way you will encounter many stumbling blocks, but it is through the process of failing that we figure out how things work.

While there will be a fair bit of coding in this course, the goal of this portion of the course is not to focus on package development. Hopefully some of you will go on to develop packages of your own, but we will not try and turn you into software engineers just yet. The aim is to get you comfortable with basic expression in the language. At this stage in your career, it is best to use carefully crafted existing packages when the need arises. You are more than welcome to look at the source code of the packages that you are using to see how professional software engineers go about developing packages. 

## Installing Julia

In order to install `Python` you can follow the instructions at the following link, [here](https://julialang.org/). Installation is quite easy to do, but if you are struggling please email me so that I can try and help. [Here]() is a video that provide some details on how to perform the installation on Windows. The process is similar (easier) for Linux and Mac.

## Can I still use RStudio for Python?

I believe that one of the reasons why `R` is so popular is the `RStudio` desktop environment. For many economics students that have experience with `Stata` or `Matlab`, it is quite comforting to move to `R` and find that there is a fully fleshed out development environment where you can execute scripts within minutes. In fact, one of the most commonly asked questions that I get for people starting out with `Python` is, *how do I run my scripts?*. For the complete beginner I would recommend trying to execute their commands in `Jupyterlab`. One can establish a nice workflow in this environment and there are several excellent extensions that make the experience quite enjoyable. There are options for `Python` that work similar to `RStudio`, such as `Spyder` and `PyCharm`, but I prefer to use `Visual Studio Code`. 

The big downside with `VS Code` is that it takes a bit more effort to set up and it is not immediately clear how to execute code. In addition, there are new concepts like terminals, workspaces and extensions that can leave the first time user confused. However, once the initial trepidation is dealt with, the end result is worth it. If you are new to `VS Code`, all you need to do is download and install the program on your system, [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a link to the website. After you have installed the program, go to **Extensions** under the **View** tab and search for `Python`. Install the `Python` extension and you will be able to run `Python` code inside of `VS Code` by pressing *Shift-Enter*, or you can run single lines by pressing *Alt-Enter*. Remember that if you want `VS Code` to recognise the script as `Pyton` code you need to add the `.py` suffix to the name of your script. We will go through this in detail in the lecture. You can basically set up `VS Code` to have a look and feel quite similar to that of `RStudio`.

## Introductory Python resources

In the context of economics, there is no better resource than the `QuantEcon` page to get started, which can be found [here](https://julia.quantecon.org/). I will often be referencing the material on this page. 

This should be enough to get you started. I will introduce more advanced material and sources as we progress. I am not going to provide extensive lists of resources on `R` and `Python` in this notebook. I will reference some resources that I think are useful as we work through the material of the course.

# Python Fundamentals

We will start with some of the basics which you have already covered with Nico Katzke in the first part of the course. This section is self-study and just gives an idea of the fundamental concepts like variables, data-types, functions, control flow and so forth. For a more complete description of the concepts I refer you to the `Think Python` book, which covers the topics in much more detail. You can also consult the `QuantEcon` notes for a similar description of the basics. Once you have worked through this section you should have a good idea of the core concepts in `Python` and then we can proceed to working with data in the next section.

## Basics 

Please take note that this is not a course in computer science, so I will be quite selective about the components that I include in this section. If you want a more complete treatment, I highly recommend `Think Python`. As you can imagine the most basic operations in any programming language are going to be arithmetic operations.
