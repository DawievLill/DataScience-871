Getting started with Julia
==============================================

In this notebook we will be going over some of the basics that you will need. There are several excellent resources to get a better understanding of the language. I will provide a list of sources that you can use to become more comfortable in using the language. The best way to learn a new language is to try and code up something that you care about. Think about a specific project and try to implement it using the new language. Along the way you will encounter many stumbling blocks, but it is through the process of failing that we figure out how things work.

While there will be a fair bit of coding in this course. The goal of this portion of the course is not to on the package development, but hopefully some of the skills will be imparted. The goal is to get you comfortable with basic expression in the language. At this stage in your career, it is best to use carefully crafted existing packages when the need arises. You are more than welcome to look at the source code of the packages that you are using to see how professional software engineers go about developing packages.

In the context of economics, there are no better resources than the `QuantEcon` page to get started, which can be found [here](https://julia.quantecon.org/). I will often be referencing the material on this page. The official `Julia` documentation is also quite good and worth reading.

Below are some resources that are worthwhile exploring

TODO: Add resource list, with indication of purpose.

I have also written a piece about the differences in programming languages and the associated software that you can use to get started. See my blog post [here](https://dawievanlill.netlify.app/posts/)
