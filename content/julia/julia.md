Getting started with Julia
==============================================

In this notebook we will be going over some of the basics that you will need. There are several excellent resources to get a better understanding of the language. I will provide a list of sources that you can use to become more comfortable in using the language. The best way to learn a new language is to try and code up something that you care about. Think about a specific project and try to implement it using the new language. Along the way you will encounter many stumbling blocks, but it is through the process of failing that we figure out how things work.

While there will be a fair bit of coding in this course. The goal of this portion of the course is not to focus on package development, but hopefully some of you will go on to develop packages of your own. The aim is to get you comfortable with basic expression in the language. At this stage in your career, it is best to use carefully crafted existing packages when the need arises. You are more than welcome to look at the source code of the packages that you are using to see how professional software engineers go about developing packages.

In the context of economics, there is no better resource than the `QuantEcon` page to get started, which can be found [here](https://julia.quantecon.org/). I will often be referencing the material on this page. The official `Julia` documentation is also quite good and worth reading. If you are interested in `Python`, there is a `QuantEcon` page dedicated to programming in `Python` that you might want to visit.

Below are some resources that are worthwhile exploring

## Julia resources

The number of resources, in comparison to other languages, are limited. However, there are some really nice tutorials that you can use to get started with `Julia`. 

## Python resources

While we do not officially cover `Python` in this course, it is one of the most popular programming languages when it comes to data science and machine learning. Therefore, I included a curated list of free resources that you can explore if you are interested in `Python`.  

## R resources

I have also included a list of resources that you can use to further develop your skills in `R`.
