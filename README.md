# DataScience 871

Additional notes for the Data Science 871 module. The code will primarily be written in Julia, but there will be accompanying R code to give a feeling for the differences between programming languages. 

## Course outline

First part focuses on data wrangling and machine learning

- Julia basics
- Data wrangling with Julia
- Linear and polynomial regression
- k-Nearest neighbours
- Tree-based methods

Second part of the course focuses on selection of topics

- Basic Shell commands
- Databases (SQL and BigQuery) 
- Parallel programming
- Cloud computing with Google Compute Engine

## Resources

For a good introduction to Julia I would recommend, 

- QuantEcon. Getting Started with Julia. https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/index.html
- Paul Soderlind. Julia Tutorial. https://github.com/PaulSoderlind/JuliaTutorial
- Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey (2018). Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html

For the first part of the course we will be using material from the following resources

- Jose Storopoli, Rik Huijzer and Lazaro Alonso (2021). Julia Data Science. https://juliadatascience.io.
- Data Science Tutorials in Julia. https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/
- Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell (2021). Hands-on Machine Learning with R. https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/

For the second part of the course we will mostly use, 

- Grant McDermott (2021). Data Science for Economists and Other Animals. https://grantmcdermott.com/ds4e/index.html
- Software Carpentry. The Unix Shell. https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
- Software Carpentry. Databases and SQL. https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/

We might use some other resources, but I will reference them as we continue.
