# Data Science for Economics and Finance

Additional notes for the Data Science 871 module. We will be using R as our primary language for this course. However, I would like to introduce you to the Julia programming language. I believe it is a good language to know for the future. Another good language to know in the data science space is Python. I can provide some resources for working in Python if anyone is interested. 

## Course outline

For my part of the course we will be looking at the following topics. 

### Data science basics

- Basic Shell commands
- Julia basics
- Data wrangling with Julia

### Machine learning 

- Fundamental concepts in machine learning
- Linear and polynomial regression
- Ridge regression and LASSO
- Decision trees
- Random forests
- Gradient boosting and bagging

### More advanced data science topics

- Introduction to SQL
- Google BigQuery 
- Parallel programming
- Cloud computing with Google Compute Engine

## Resources

For a good introduction to Julia I would recommend, 

- QuantEcon. Getting Started with Julia. https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/index.html
- Paul Soderlind. Julia Tutorial. https://github.com/PaulSoderlind/JuliaTutorial
- Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey (2018). Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html

For the data science basics and machine learning we will be using material from the following resources

- Software Carpentry. The Unix Shell. https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
- Jose Storopoli, Rik Huijzer and Lazaro Alonso (2021). Julia Data Science. https://juliadatascience.io.
- Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell (2021). Hands-on Machine Learning with R. https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/
- Data Science Tutorials in Julia. https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/

For the more advanced pirtion we will mostly use, 

- Grant McDermott (2021). Data Science for Economists and Other Animals. https://grantmcdermott.com/ds4e/index.html
- Software Carpentry. Databases and SQL. https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/

We might use some other resources, but I will reference them as we continue.
