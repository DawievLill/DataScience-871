# Data Science for Economics and Finance

On this page we have the course notes for the second part of the Data Science 871 module. The first part is taught by [Nico Katzke](https://github.com/nicktz) and focuses on data wrangling and programming practives. We will be using R as our primary language for this course. However, I would like to introduce you to the Julia programming language. Julia is used more in scientific computing, but recently there has been a shift toward using Julia for application in Data Science. This will definitely be a language to keep an eye out for in the future. Another really popular language for data science is Python. We will quickly talk about the differences between these languages throughout the course. We hope that you realise after this course that the choice of language is not important to your success. Most languages are very similar and you should be able to switch pretty easily between languages once you know the basic principles of programming. My advice for the beginner is to pick the language you can most easily express yourself in when attempting new projects. Become comfortable with that language and then you can look to expand your portfolio. 

Below are my details. You can contact me via email. If I don't respond within a day or so, please remind me with a follow up email.

## Final project

In this part of the course there is no exam, only a final project. We will discuss this project in more detail during the semester. However, the basic idea is that you apply machine learning techniques to any type of data that you find interesting. The topic should ideally be related to economics. Please consult with me about your topics, so that we can talk about the availability of data and whether the project is feasible. 



## Resources

For a good introduction to Julia I would recommend, 

- [Julia] QuantEcon. Getting Started with Julia. https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/index.html
- [Julia] Paul Soderlind. Julia Tutorial. https://github.com/PaulSoderlind/JuliaTutorial
- [Julia] Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey (2018). Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html

For the data science basics and machine learning we will be using material from the following resources (I am providing some resources in R, Python and Julia)

- [Shell] Software Carpentry. The Unix Shell. https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
- [R] Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell (2021). Hands-on Machine Learning with R. https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/
- [Julia] Jose Storopoli, Rik Huijzer and Lazaro Alonso (2021). Julia Data Science. https://juliadatascience.io.
- [Julia] Data Science Tutorials in Julia. https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/

For the more advanced portion we will mostly use, 

- [R] Grant McDermott (2021). Data Science for Economists and Other Animals. https://grantmcdermott.com/ds4e/index.html
- [SQL] Software Carpentry. Databases and SQL. https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/

We might use some other resources, but I will reference them as we continue.
