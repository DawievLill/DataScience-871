# DataScience 871

Additional notes for the Data Science 871 module. The code will primarily be written in Julia, but there will be accompanying R code to give a feeling for the differences between programming languages. 

## Course outline

First part focuses on data wrangling and machine learning

1. Julia basics
2. Data wrangling with Julia
3. Linear and polynomial regression
4. k-Nearest neighbours
5. Tree-based methods

Second part of the course focuses on selection of topics

1. Basic Shell commands
2. Databases (SQL and BigQuery) 
3. Parallel programming
4. Cloud computing with Google Compute Engine

## Resources

For a good introduction to Julia I would recommend, 

1. Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey (2018). Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html

For the first part of the course we will be using material from the following resources

1. Jose Storopoli, Rik Huijzer and Lazaro Alonso (2021). Julia Data Science. https://juliadatascience.io.
2. Data Science Tutorials in Julia. https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/
3. Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell (2021). Hands-on Machine Learning with R. https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/

For the second part of the course we will mostly use, 

1. Grant McDermott (2021). Data Science for Economists and Other Animals. https://grantmcdermott.com/ds4e/index.html
2. Software Carpentry. The Unix Shell. https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
3. Software Carpentry. Databases and SQL. https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/

We might use some other resources, but I will reference them as we continue.
